"""Execution clients.

Judgment call from the polymarket_arb read-through (see bot/PLAN.md): the
CLOB order-book / dual-leg-fill model in polymarket_arb/execution.py does
NOT transfer -- there is no "combined YES+NO ask" concept for a single-name
equity long/short PEAD trade, no partial-fill hedge-or-exit dance across
two legs of the SAME trade. What DOES transfer is the *shape* of a
broker-API-style execution-client abstraction with an explicit paper vs.
live split, exactly like polymarket_arb/config.py's `dry_run` /
`paper_trade` / `live` distinction and
polymarket_arb/clients/trading_client.py's PAPER_TRADE fill simulation
(walk a REST book to a synthetic fill, log identically to a real fill).
Here there is no order book to walk -- equities paper-fills are simulated
against the last real trade price instead.

`PaperExecutionClient` is a working simulator: it fetches a REAL current
price via yfinance for the requested ticker and "fills" the order
immediately at that price (no book, no slippage model -- documented
simplification, see class docstring). Orders sent to a real broker (paper or
live account) go through bot/broker_execution.py, which reuses this class's
ledger and accounting; bot/broker_config.py decides which one a cycle uses.

    Simplification (documented, not silent): fills happen at the current

    execution slippage beyond a flat transaction-cost bps assumption, so

    the entry and exit notionals, at risk/transaction_costs.py's 10 bps -- the
    same assumption the cost-adjusted training label and every research
    backtest in this repo already use. Before this, the paper account was the
    only thing here quoting returns gross of fees, which overstated it by
    roughly 0.4%/yr at the bot's current turnover. Charging at the close (not
    half at entry) keeps the invariant the whole system is built on: cash-basis
    NAV changes on a close event and nowhere else, so from_ledger, the
    dashboard's stats and its equity curve all stay correct without each
    re-deriving a cost model. An open position is therefore marked before its
