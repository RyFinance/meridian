"""The orchestration entry point: one full trading cycle.

Wires together, in this order, every module bot/ already has (nothing new
is reimplemented here -- this is glue, not logic):

  1. kill_switch / execution.from_ledger  -- reconstruct paper account state.
     Each cycle is a FRESH process (cron re-invokes this script; there is
     no long-lived in-memory bot). State survives only via the JSONL
     ledger, replayed on every start -- see execution.py's from_ledger
     docstring for why that's correct, not a workaround.
  2. position_manager.process_exits        -- close anything that has hit
     its fixed 20-trading-day holding period. Exits are ALWAYS processed
     before new entries are considered, and exits are never gated by the
     circuit breaker (an open position closing on schedule is not a "new
     entry" -- see risk_gate.py's own comment on this).
  3. earnings_watcher.get_recently_reported -- real trigger: what in the
     validated 75-name universe reported earnings in the last few days.
  4. signal_pipeline.score_event            -- real SUE -> calibrated
     probability, using the model fit on the EXPANDED, statistically-
     validated dataset (see signal_pipeline.py's fit_or_load docstring).
  5. risk_gate.evaluate                     -- the sole path to an approval
     token. Kill switch, drawdown cap, circuit breaker, Kelly size, E2
     limits -- exactly as built, nothing loosened.
  6. execution.place_order                  -- paper fill at a real price,
     JSONL ledger write, only if step 5 approved.

Before any of that, `prepare_market_session` refreshes the cached daily
bars the circuit breaker reads and decides whether `as_of` is a completed
regular session. Exits and entries only happen on one: on a weekend,
holiday, or a run before the 4pm ET close (e.g. launchd's RunAtLoad firing
at night), a paper fill would use a stale or pre-announcement price.
Earnings events already evaluated in an earlier cycle are not re-scored, so
an event rejected on its effective day cannot slip in days later.

Every cycle's outcome (exits, entries considered, entries placed, entries
blocked and why) is appended to bot/state/cycle_log.jsonl so a history of
runs is inspectable without replaying the trade ledger by hand.

NAV in the cycle log: nav_before / nav_after are the cash-basis NAV
(PaperExecutionClient.nav(), open positions at cost) -- the value that sizes
and gates trades, unchanged. On a completed session the cycle also records
marked_nav: cash plus every open position at that day's close, taken AFTER all
exits and entries, so marking cannot influence a decision. marks holds the
price used per open position and unmarked any position that could not be
priced (carried at cost, and reported in errors). Performance -- Sharpe,
volatility, drawdown -- is computed from marked_nav (bot/performance.py).

# (Those Sharpes are cash-basis with a zero risk-free rate. Marked daily and in
# excess of T-bills, the 5.0%/100% configuration is about 0.70 if idle cash
# earns the T-bill rate (reports/pead_audit/REPORT.md), and about 0.49 as the
# paper account actually runs, idle cash earning nothing -- the basis the
# dashboard and live_backtest/compute_final_metrics.py now report.)
# Deliberate, operator-chosen trade: the highest net return of the set, bought
# with risk rather than edge -- its Sharpe is the LOWEST of the three wide
# configurations and its drawdown the deepest, exceeding the original's. Gross
# exposure stops at 100% of NAV, so the bot never borrows. The 20% drawdown
# kill switch (bot/kill_switch.py) is unchanged and still sits well below the
# -10.6% this configuration drew down historically.
