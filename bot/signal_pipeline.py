"""earnings/sue.py -> earnings/features.py -> a loaded/fitted ML filter ->
calibrated probability, for a FRESH (just-reported) earnings event.

MODEL PERSISTENCE (documented choice): there is no model-persistence
(pickle/joblib save) anywhere in quant_v7 today -- every `reports/run_*.py`
script fits the ensemble + calibrator fresh, in-process, from cached
parquet, every time it runs. Re-fitting on every bot invocation would be
correct but slow (day-of-earnings decisions do not need sub-second
latency, unlike the polymarket_arb bot this project started from -- see
bot/PLAN.md's "what transfers" judgment). `fit_or_load()` therefore adds a
minimal joblib persistence layer: fit once, cache to
`bot/state/model/pead_model.joblib`, reuse until the cache is deleted or
`force_refit=True`. This is new, minimal, and scoped to this package --
it does not change how reports/run_pead_ml_filter.py or
reports/run_pead_backtest.py work.

LIVE-SCORING DEVIATION (documented, not silent): the historical feature
build (earnings/features.py::build_pead_feature_matrix) computes
pre_earnings_return_5d/20d from RESIDUAL (market-beta-stripped) returns via
clustering/residual_returns.py's cached panel. That panel is a Phase-1/2
batch artifact computed over the full historical universe; there is no live
residual-return pipeline running in this scaffolding. For a fresh event
this module instead computes a RAW (non-residualized) trailing return from
real recently-fetched prices (data.ingestion.fetch_ticker_history) as a
momentum proxy. This is a real, working number from real data, but it is
NOT the same feature distribution the model was trained on -- flagged
here, and again in bot/PLAN.md, as a gap a real deployment would need to
close (e.g. by running the Phase-1/2 residual-return pipeline on a
schedule) before trusting this signal's probabilities at face value.
