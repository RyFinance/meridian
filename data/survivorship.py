"""Survivorship-bias-free universe history.

Source: Wikipedia's "List of S&P 500 companies" page. It carries two tables
we need:
  1. Current constituents (ticker, name, sector, date added).
  2. "Selected changes to the list of S&P 500 components" — a historical log
     of additions/removals with dates, going back to ~1990s (deepest for
     recent decades). This is what lets us avoid survivorship bias: we can
     reconstruct which names were actually in the index on any given
     historical date, rather than backfilling today's membership.

Deviation from quant_v6 roadmap: that roadmap never addressed survivorship
bias at all (it only ever queries current tickers). This module is new for
v7, driven directly by the spec's explicit requirement.

Plain `urllib.request.urlopen()` gets HTTP 403 from Wikipedia — a User-Agent
header identifying the client is required (confirmed empirically).
