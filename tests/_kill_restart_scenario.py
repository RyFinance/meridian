"""Not a pytest module (underscore-prefixed, not collected). Standalone
subprocess target for tests/test_bot_kill_restart_integration.py: forces
THREE fake reported-earnings events through a real run_cycle(), with a
deliberate pause injected between each order placement so an external
process has a reliable window to SIGKILL this one mid-cycle -- simulating
a real crash between the 1st and 2nd/3rd orders, not a clean shutdown.

Usage: python3 tests/_kill_restart_scenario.py <ledger_path> <cycle_log_path> <kill_switch_path>
